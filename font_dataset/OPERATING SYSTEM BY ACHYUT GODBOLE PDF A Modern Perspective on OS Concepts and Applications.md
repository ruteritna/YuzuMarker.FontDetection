# Operating System by Achyut Godbole: A Comprehensive Guide to the Fundamentals of Operating Systems
 
Operating systems are the software that manage the resources and activities of a computer. They provide an interface between the hardware and the applications that run on it. Operating systems are essential for the efficient and secure functioning of any computing system.
 
One of the books that covers the concepts and principles of operating systems in a clear and concise manner is *Operating System by Achyut Godbole*. This book, published by McGraw-Hill Education (India) Pvt Limited in 2005, has 692 pages and 7 reviews on Google Books[^1^] [^2^]. It aims to demystify the subject using a simplified step-wise approach of going from the basic fundamentals concepts to advanced topics such as memory management, process synchronization, file systems, security, and distributed systems[^3^]. The book also includes numerous examples, diagrams, exercises, and case studies to illustrate the theoretical concepts and practical applications of operating systems.
