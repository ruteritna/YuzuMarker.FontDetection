# How to Use Atapwd Exe 47 to Unlock Hard Disk Passwords
 
Atapwd exe 47 is a DOS program that can set or remove passwords at the hard disk controller level. This means that the password is stored on the disk itself and not on the BIOS or the operating system. This can be useful for protecting your data from unauthorized access or for unlocking a disk that has been locked by a forgotten password.

In this article, we will show you how to use atapwd exe 47 to unlock hard disk passwords for different types of drives, such as Western Digital, Toshiba, and others. We will also explain the risks and limitations of this method and provide some alternatives for more secure and reliable data protection.
 
## What is Atapwd Exe 47?
 
Atapwd exe 47 is a modified version of atapwd, a program written by Alex Mina that can manipulate ATA passwords on hard disks. ATA passwords are a feature of the ATA-3 specification that allows setting a user password and a master password on a disk. The user password is required to access the disk normally, while the master password can be used to unlock or erase the disk in case the user password is lost or forgotten.
 
Atapwd exe 47 has some additional features that make it more effective for unlocking hard disk passwords. For example, it can bypass some security checks that prevent unlocking certain drives, such as Western Digital ones. It can also use a list of known master passwords for various brands and models of disks. However, it is not guaranteed to work on all disks, especially newer ones that have more advanced security features.
 
## How to Use Atapwd Exe 47 to Unlock Hard Disk Passwords?
 
To use atapwd exe 47 to unlock hard disk passwords, you will need the following:
 
- A bootable DOS floppy disk or USB drive
- The atapwd exe 47 program (you can download it from [here](https://forum.hddguru.com/viewtopic.php?t=16429&start=))
- The locked hard disk and a compatible laptop or desktop computer (you may need an adapter for 2.5" disks)

Here are the steps to follow:

1. Remove the locked hard disk from your device and connect it to another computer using an IDE cable or an adapter.
2. Boot from the DOS floppy disk or USB drive and run atapwd exe 47.
3. Select the locked hard disk from the list and press Enter to access the menu.
4. If you know the user password or the master password, you can enter them using the Unlock with user password or Unlock with master password options. If you don't know them, you can try using the Disable with master password option, which will attempt to use a list of known master passwords for different disks. You can also try using the Erase with master password option, which will erase all data on the disk and remove the password (this may take several hours).
5. If none of these options work, you can try using the Security Erase Prepare command, which will prepare the disk for a security erase operation. This may unlock some disks that are otherwise resistant to unlocking. However, this command may also erase some data on the disk, so use it with caution.
6. If you manage to unlock or erase the disk, you can exit atapwd exe 47 and reboot your computer. You should be able to access your disk normally or format it as needed.
